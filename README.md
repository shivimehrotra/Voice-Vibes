• Created a real-time speech emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving an
accuracy of 78% in predicting emotions from audio data.
• Integrated the CNN model with a Next-based frontend, enabling real-time audio recording, processing, and emotion
prediction within the web application.
• Implemented backend services using Flask to handle audio data processing and model inference for seamless
communication between the frontend and backend.
